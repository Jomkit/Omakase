### Project idea: Study Buddy**
**Problem**: Many students nowadays don’t know the proper way to study, or have only ever learned one way to study, which is often just rote memorization. As a result, students end up cramming material the day before a quiz or test. They think they understand the topic when they’ve only memorized the outermost layer, lacking in-depth understanding.

**Solution**: Study Buddy is a collection of tools designed to help students focus their studying and explore different methods of studying. The base functionality consists of a pomodoro timer, a planner page to plan out study, and a reminder (email?) sent at the beginning of each day or set time to study certain topics. 


### Project idea: Omakase***
**Problem**: For many restaurants, the traditional workflow goes like this: order comes in from either the phone or a table to a waitstaff, they write it down, and then it goes to the kitchen where the order info is put in a queue. Small businesses and franchises alike have some variation similar to this. At small quantities it is manageable, but during busy hours it can be difficult to keep track of orders, especially in a reasonable time. 

**Solution**: Omakase is a restaurant time-management tool intended to help restaurants place and track orders by handling order input and editing, order queueing, tracking progress of orders, and handling billing/payment. 

**Extra Functionality**:
Tablet menu with real-time estimate of how long some dishes may take

### Project Idea: Stroll*

**Problem**: Oftentimes it’s a good idea to go for a walk and clear your head if you’ve gone hours without a break. Or maybe you want to go on a nice scenic route, but don’t want to get caught out in the rain. 

**Solution**: Stroll is a running/walking route planning app that suggests a route for users depending on weather forecasts and user-inputted route preferences (scenic, quiet, straight/rounding…)
